>>>>>>>>>> File Structure 

1) node_modules contains all the packages used for creating angular project
2) src folder will be source code of your peoject 
3) package.json package.json is the description of your project lets say later u install one package gmail-login
  gmail-login will be added as a dependency into package.json


  npm install inside the project will install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json into node_modules

  TO start the project one time 
  ng serve


  ng serve starts a http server in your system , http server is by default listening to 4200 port number 
  once server is started go to browser and open http://localhost:4200

  Angular says create you project into small pieces of components 
  Component based architecture 


  Divide your app into components and integrate them together 

For example login , signup , forgot , video , videolist navbar , carousel

What is a component 
Component is basically a reusable entity which u see in your project 

component is whatever u see on ur screen 


Appcomponent is the one which is created by ng serve 

when u run ng serve

1) A server is created and running at 4200
2) that server sends your index.html file inside the browser
3) index.html file shows a component to you which is app component 


A component which is placed inside index.html is known as Root Component
go to app.module.ts and check bootstrap array and tell me which component will go into index.html ?

Similarly everything in angular is a class

When someone ask to create a component what will we create 
we will create a class 


// creating a component 

3 parts -- 

creation  - create a folder with 3 files for example carousel corousel.component.ts , corousel.component.html corousel.component.css.   In ts file create a component class


declaration 
usage 


<app-button>

>>>>>>>>>>>>> To create component using cli >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
ng generate component componentname

ng generate component signup
it will create the component for u and it will declare the component as well 



After creating components 
We will design 

FOr designing we will use external library BOOTSTRAP 

// integrate by cdn
getbootstrap.com and include cdn of css and js into index.html


to use images in angular put it in inside assets folder in src and use path with extension 

Example 
<img src="assets/imagename.jpeg">
<img src="assets/imagename.jpg">
<img src="assets/imagename.png">
<img src="assets/imagename.webp">


Data Binding -- showing data of component class into component html via INTERPLATION    {{}} DOUBLE CURLY BRACES
If i have to show data in any component html it must come from ts of that component


Event binding --- calling the function on events happening
